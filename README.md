Throughout this course you will be introduced to fundamental programming concepts using the Java Programming language.  We will start out by receiving an overview of appropriate software development processes required to analyze and solve a problem using a process-based approach.  You will then be introduced to the basics of object-oriented programming concepts using the Java programming language.  You will learn a number of important concepts, including a grasp of basic data types, programming control structures, basic data structures, and algorithmic processes. Specifically, you will gain an understanding of developing programs with a focus on design structure, decision-making, utilizing loops, arrays, and objects to create a software program.
